This Rust project demonstrates how to generate Ed25519 key pairs, sign invoices and receipts, and verify signatures. 
It includes serialization to JSON and encoding/decoding of signatures using base64.

It includes the following;
1. Generate Ed25519 key pairs for signing and verification.
2. Sign invoices and receipts using the generated keys.
3. Verify the signatures on receipts to ensure authenticity.
4. Encode and decode signatures using base64.
